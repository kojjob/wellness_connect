## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Trust & Professionalism**: Healthcare requires higher trust signals than e-commerce
2. **Information Hierarchy**: Critical information (credentials, ratings, booking) prominently displayed
3. **User-Centric Navigation**: Tabbed interface reduces cognitive load and scroll fatigue
4. **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
5. **Mobile-First Responsive**: Optimized for mobile users who represent majority of healthcare seekers

### Transformation from E-Commerce to Healthcare

| E-Commerce Element | Healthcare Adaptation |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Product images | Provider avatar + office photos + credentials |
| Product description | Professional bio + philosophy |
| Product features | Services offered + treatment modalities |
| Product specs | Qualifications (education, certifications, experience) |
| Pricing tiers | Consultation rates + session packages |
| Reviews | Patient testimonials + ratings |
| Add to cart | Book Appointment CTA |
| Seller info | Practice/clinic information |
| Shipping | Availability calendar + booking widget |

## Page Structure

### 1. Breadcrumb Navigation
- **Purpose**: Helps users understand their location in the site hierarchy
- **Implementation**: Home → Providers → [Provider Name]
- **Accessibility**: Proper `aria-label="Breadcrumb"` and semantic nav element

### 2. Hero Section
**Components:**
- Large provider avatar (48x48 on mobile, maintains aspect ratio)
- Verification badge (green checkmark)
- Provider name (H1, 4xl-5xl font size)
- Credentials subtitle
- Specialty and experience badges
- Star rating display
- Quick action buttons (Book, Message, Share)
- Decorative gradient background with wave divider

**Design Decisions:**
- Gradient background (indigo-600 → purple-600 → indigo-800) creates premium feel
- White text on dark background ensures high contrast (WCAG AAA)
- Decorative blur elements add depth without distracting
- Wave SVG divider creates smooth transition to content area

### 3. Main Content Area (2/3 Width)

#### Tabbed Navigation System
**Tabs:**
1. **About** - Professional background, philosophy, qualifications
2. **Services** - Service packages with pricing
3. **Media** - Photos, videos, documents (conditional rendering)
4. **Reviews** - Patient testimonials and ratings
5. **FAQ** - Common questions with accordion

**Benefits:**
- Reduces initial page load cognitive burden
- Allows users to find specific information quickly
- Maintains clean, uncluttered interface
- Supports deep linking via URL hash (#about, #services, etc.)

**Accessibility Features:**
- Proper ARIA roles (`role="tab"`, `role="tabpanel"`)
- `aria-selected` states
- `aria-hidden` for inactive panels
- Keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Home, End)
- Focus indicators for keyboard users

### 4. Sidebar (1/3 Width, Sticky)

**Components:**
1. **Quick Stats** - Experience, rating, sessions, response time
2. **Contact Information** - Phone, email, address, website, social media
3. **Office Hours** - Weekly schedule (placeholder for future database field)
4. **Insurance Accepted** - List of accepted providers (placeholder)

**Sticky Behavior:**
- `sticky top-24` keeps sidebar visible during scroll
- Improves conversion by keeping booking CTA accessible
- Mobile: Stacks below main content
